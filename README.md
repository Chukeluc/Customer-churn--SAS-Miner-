Executive Summary (Preface)
This group project presents a real-world predictive analytics solution for Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), developed using SAS Enterprise Miner. Working collaboratively, we analyzed customer behavioral and demographic data to build models that identify individuals at high risk of churn. Techniques applied include Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks, with a focus on accuracy, interpretability, and actionable insights.

This project demonstrates my ability to apply advanced analytics to real-world business problems â€” particularly in customer retention, financial analytics, and predictive modeling â€” by cleaning and preparing data, building interpretable models, and translating complex insights into clear, actionable business recommendations.
