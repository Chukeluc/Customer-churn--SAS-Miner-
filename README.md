Executive Summary (Preface)
This group project presents a real-world predictive analytics solution for Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), developed using SAS Enterprise Miner. Working collaboratively, we analyzed customer behavioral and demographic data to build models that identify individuals at high risk of churn. Techniques applied include Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks, with a focus on accuracy, interpretability, and actionable insights.

My contributions included data preparation, exploratory analysis, model selection, and translating results into business strategy recommendations. The project demonstrates my ability to apply advanced analytics to solve real business problems â€” particularly in customer retention, financial analytics, and predictive modeling.
